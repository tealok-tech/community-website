## About Tealok

Tealok takes its name from "Teallach," the Gaelic word for hearth—a symbol of warmth, stability, and transformation. In traditional homes, the hearth served as the heart of the household, offering comfort and resilience. Similarly, Tealok is designed to be the digital hearth of modern homes, providing a secure, stable, and empowering foundation for managing technology.

At its core, Tealok is a powerful home server, built to put control back into the hands of its users. It transforms the overwhelming forces of the digital world into tools for productivity, creativity, and personal growth—all securely contained within the sanctity of your home. By enabling seamless connectivity and unparalleled privacy, Tealok helps families and individuals harness technology to enhance their lives.

Tealok isn’t just a product; it’s a commitment to autonomy, data security, and enduring innovation. It stands as a bulwark against the chaotic digital landscape, ensuring homes remain places of comfort, prosperity, and peace.

## About Gleipnir LLC

At Gleipnir LLC, we fight for the user.

Technology holds immense power—power that has often been wielded to nudge, cajole, and harvest users for profit. We reject this approach. Instead, we believe technology should protect, serve, and empower. Fighting for the user means having principles, leaving some money on the table, and building tools that genuinely improve the world for more people.

Every decision we make, every product we design, stems from this core mission: **We fight for the user.**

The name Gleipnir is inspired by the mythical chain that bound the great wolf Fenrir in Norse mythology—a symbol of ingenuity, strength, and the ability to master powerful forces. Just as Gleipnir held the seemingly uncontainable, we aim to harness the complexities of modern technology, making it accessible, secure, and beneficial to all.

Yes, we’re in business to make money—we all need to eat—but money isn’t our primary motivator. At Gleipnir LLC, we’re here to create solutions that empower individuals and families, ensuring they retain control over their technology. From Tealok to every future innovation, we are committed to making technology a force for good.

Every day. All day. **We fight for the user.**
