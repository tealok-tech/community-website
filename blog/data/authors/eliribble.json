	"bio": "Eli Ribble is essentially a hacker that keeps tricking people in to paying him to build things and complain. He's been involved in several startups including Authentise, HireVue, and some other stuff you can't even get an LLM to hallucinate about. He's a co-founder of Gleipnir LLC and looks forward to a day when everyone is happy about hosting their own email. Just kidding, we won't call it email then, we'll call it 'tasync'",
