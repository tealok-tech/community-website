**Our Mission: Empowering Your Digital Life**

At Tealok, we believe in a world where technology enhances our lives rather than detracts from it. Our mission is simple yet profound: to give individuals and families the tools they need to reclaim their digital lives, fostering an environment of safety, creativity, and prosperity. We are committed to creating a future where every home is a sanctuary in the digital age, free from exploitation and filled with opportunity.

#### **The Inspiration Behind Tealok**

Tealok’s story begins with a simple yet powerful idea: that the home should be a place of security and growth, even in our increasingly connected world. The name "Tealok" is inspired by the Gaelic word "Tealloch," which means hearth. In times past, the hearth was the heart of the home—a place of warmth, safety, and productivity. It was where families gathered, where meals were cooked, and where stories were told.

Today, the digital world has introduced new challenges and opportunities. The internet is a powerful tool, but it also comes with risks that can harm individuals and families if left unchecked. Just as the hearth once contained the power of fire, Tealok is designed to securely harness the power of the internet, turning it into a force for good within your home.

#### **Our Vision: A Better Digital Future**

We envision a world where technology serves humanity, where digital tools empower individuals and strengthen families. We’re working to create a future where your data is your own, where your connections are meaningful, and where your creativity can flourish without fear of exploitation.

Tealok is just the beginning. As we continue to develop and refine our products, our goal is to build a suite of tools that support you in every aspect of your digital life, from productivity and creativity to security and privacy. We are committed to helping you achieve your aspirations, providing the foundation you need to thrive in the modern world.

He went to school for a while at the University of Utah and eventually moved on to a string of small companies and startups. He's worked on graphics engines, driving simulators, mobile device fleet management, online interviewing, pest control logistics, and 3D printing software. Recently he did a stint at Google working on devices that listen to you in your home. He's driven by the idea of giving people superpowers and the promise that computing has yet to fulfill in making everyone more powerful.

#### **Why We Care**

Our work is driven by a simple truth: we care about our neighbors. We understand the pain of feeling lost in the digital world, of being overwhelmed by the noise and exploitation that often accompany it. But we also know that it doesn’t have to be this way. We believe that with the right tools, every person can create a life of meaning and fulfillment, free from the shadow of surveillance capitalism.

Tealok is our way of giving back, of offering something that can truly make a difference in people’s lives. We’re not just building a product; we’re building a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
