  - **Specs at a Glance**:
    - **Processor**: AMD Ryzen 9 series for optimal performance.
    - **Memory**: 32 GB of DDR5 RAM to handle multiple applications and processes.
    - **Storage**: 1 TB SSD for fast, reliable storage, with options for additional storage as needed.
2. **Customizability**:
  
  - **DIY Enthusiasts**: While we recommend our pre-assembled units for ease of use, Tealok can also be installed on custom-built hardware for those who prefer to tailor their system to specific needs. Our recommended specs are available for those who want to build their own Lar.

#### **The Software: Tealok – The Brain Behind the System**

1. **NixOS Foundation**:
  
  - **Why NixOS?**: Tealok is built on NixOS, a Linux distribution known for its reliability, reproducibility, and security. NixOS allows us to precisely manage system configurations and ensure that every Tealok deployment is consistent and stable.
  - **Containerization**: Tealok leverages Docker containers to isolate applications, ensuring that each service runs smoothly and securely without interfering with others.
2. **Key Software Components**:
  
  - **Tealok Core**: The central software that manages all operations, from data storage to application performance.
  - **Rclone**: Used for managing backups, Rclone ensures that your data is safely stored and easily recoverable.
  - **Postgres**: A robust and reliable database system that supports the backend operations of Tealok applications.
3. **Advanced Features**:
  
  - **Durable Storage**: Tealok’s storage system is designed to last, with automatic backups to ensure that your data is preserved even in the event of hardware failure.
  - **User Authentication**: Tealok includes a secure onboarding flow for setting up user accounts and managing access to services, ensuring that your data remains private and protected.

#### **Networking: Seamless and Secure Connectivity**

1. **Local and Remote Access**:
  
  - **DNS-SD for Service Discovery**: Tealok uses DNS-SD (Service Discovery) to make it easy for devices on your local network to find and connect to Tealok services.
  - **Public DNS Support**: For users running public-facing services like email or web hosting, Tealok supports custom DNS configurations, allowing you to manage your digital presence with ease.
2. **Security and Privacy**:
  
  - **TLS Certificates**: Tealok automatically provisions TLS certificates for secure connections, ensuring that all data transmitted over the network is encrypted and protected.
  - **VPN Support**: While not required, Tealok can integrate with VPNs like Tailscale to provide additional security and privacy for your networked services.
